# Data Directory – Reva

This directory contains all data-related assets used in the Reva project.
The goal of this structure is to ensure **reproducibility, clarity, and safe collaboration**
while supporting multiple machine learning models.

This folder is **not just for storing data**, but for documenting **how data is transformed**
from raw inputs into model-ready features.
