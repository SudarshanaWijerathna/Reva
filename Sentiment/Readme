Data extracking and sentiment setting pipeline (ochestration.pipe) and 
similarity adding pipeline (semantic_filter) is working individually they are neither conbine
nor connected to the aggregator, aggregator act alone to fetch the db individually and print output

all you need to do is -> Root - Sentiment :python -m Analysis.sentiment_aggregate.agg_pipe
if you want to update the db, run Root - Sentiment :python -m Analysis.ochestration.pipe
Root - Sentiment :python -m Analysis.semantic_filter.semantic_pipeline in thread

you can run them both in run_both.py inside Analysis
